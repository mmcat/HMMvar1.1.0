HMMvar: profile hidden Markov model based genetic variants functional effects prediction

HMMvar is a tool for automatically give a score to a genetic variant that measures the deleterious effect of the mutation. It can measure any type of variants, 
such as single nucleiotide polymorphism (SNP), insertions and deletions (indel), etc. It can also measure the whole effect of a combination of different variants,
such as the functional effect of compensatory indels.

Please send any questions, comments and suggestions to: mingml@vt.edu  


Input
=====

1. cDNA query sequence or amino acid sequence

2. necleotide variants or amino acid variants 

-- format for cDNA query sequence or amino acid sequence file: Fasta, e.x.

> seq1
ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCA
GACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCCTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATG

-- format for necleotide variants file: The following is an example of an input variant file

#comments row
1	GA/T	4	#comments columns
2	CC/-	10	#comments columns
1	GCA/AT	12	#comments columns
...

Three required fields: The first fied is the group number of a variant, by which we are able to score multiple variants within the
same group. The second field is a representative of a variant (major allele/minor allele). The second filed is the 
coordinat of the variant (starts with 1). You can also add additional columns following these three fields or rows for your 
as comments starting with '#'. However, these three columns must be the first three columns as have the format and order as stated.


Prerequirements
===============

1. NCBI Blast 2.2.27+ (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) 

2. NCBI nr database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/)

3. HMMER3 (http://hmmer.janelia.org/)

4. MUSCLE aligner (http://www.drive5.com/muscle/)


Installation
============

Make suer that all the prerequired packages have been installed properly. Download and extract HMMvar package to a local directory.

$ tar -xzvf HMMvar1.0.tar.gz 

1. configure	
	$./configure

2. complile
	$make

3. install
	$make install

If you receive an error during configuration that psiblast, blastdbcmd,
muscle or HMM cannot be found, and you have indeed installed it, then place
it in your PATH variable, or specify its location:

e.g.)
	
	$ ./configure PSIBLAST=/path/to/psiblast
	$ ./configure MUSCLE=/path/to/muscle
	$ ./configure HMM = /path/to/hmm/
	$ ./configure BLASTDBCMD = /path/to/blastdbcmd
	$ ./configure PSIBLAST=/path/to/psiblast MUSCLE=/path/to/muscle HMM = /path/to/hmm/ BLASTDBCMD=/path/to/blastdbcmd


Setting
=======

If you did not specify the location of NCBI nr database during installation, 
then you may edit Common.h file in the source folder or set it via programming option.
      
You can also change the path to psiblast, blastdbcmd, muscle or hmm in a
similar way if you want to use different version.

        e.g.)
        BLAST_DB = "/path/to/blast/database/nr"
        PSIBLAST = "/path/to/psiblast"
        BLASTDBCMD = "/path/to/blastdbcmd"
        MUSCLE = "/path/to/muscle"
        HMMPATH = "/path/to/hmm"

The default paths for these programmings are as follows,

	BLAST_DB = "<home>/blast/db/nr"
	PSIBLAST = "/usr/local/ncbi/blast/bin/psiblast"
	BLASTDBCMD = "/usr/local/ncbi/blast/bin/blastdbcmd"
	MUSCLE = "/usr/local/bin/muscle"
	HMMPATH = "/usr/local/bin/"


Running
======= 

1. If the options are not input correctly, the HMMvar usage instructions will show:

USAGE:
  hmmvar [Options]

Options:
  -q <query sequence filename (required)>
  -d <database search>
  -v <variant filename (required)>
  --psiblastcmd <path to PSIBLAST>
  --musclecmd <path to MUSCLE>
  --hmmercmd <path to HMMER>
  --blastdbcmd <path to BLASTDBCMD>
  --seqtype <sequence type, prot or nucl, default nucl>
  --save_blastout <save psiblast output to filename>
  --blastout <psiblast output filename>
  Note: Please set all the paths correctly if you are not usinig the default paths.

Example: hmmvar -q <query filename> -v <variants filename>

Note: 
(i) Please use '--seqtype prot' option when your input query sequence is amino acids. And the corresponding variants file should also be about amino acid changes. 
(ii) If you saved the psiblast output file after the first run using --save_blastout option, you can use --blastout option in the following runs. So the hmmvar won't run psiblast again to save plenty of time. 
(iii) If you have pre-computed profile hidden Markov model, you can use --hmmbuildout option to specify the HMM to save running time.

2. Run HMMvar with tested example:

Set paths properly as stated above,then install HMMvar. 

If install the programming successfully, run it as follows:

$hmmVar -q data/tp53_cDNA.fa -v data/tp53_simu.var

3. After running the program, you will get a output file called hmmVar.out 
containing variants information and the corresponding scores 
at the current directory. for example, 

G/T     4       1.799	#comments
G/-     7       0.998	#comments
...

Other Scripts
=============

1. HGVS2HMMvar.pl

We use this script to convert the HGVS variants format to HMMvar input format. 

For example, c.7294_7295delGT ==> 1	GT/-	7294

Usage: perl HGVS2HMMvar.pl -s <fasta file> -v <variant file> -g <group column index> -c <HGVE allele column index>

The inputs include the query fast file, variant file with HGVE format, the variant ID column index and HGVE name column index in the variant file. 
The index starts with 0.

2. CompensatoryIndels.cpp

This is a multithreads programming for generating compensatory indel sets for given variants. The input file is a HMMvar input variant file. 

Example: ./CompensatoryIndels <HMMvar format variants file>

Please use 
	export OMP_THREADS_NUM = <the number of threads>
to set the number of workers.

Here is an example of the output:

#find compensary for var:221	C/-	76
221_0	-/X	96	290
221_0	C/-	94	6408
221_0	C/-	80	6588
221_0	C/-	79	232
221_0	C/-	76	221
221_1	C/-	94	6408
221_1	C/-	80	6588
221_1	C/-	76	221
221_2	C/-	94	6408
221_2	C/-	79	232
221_2	C/-	76	221
221_3	C/-	80	6588
221_3	C/-	79	232
221_3	C/-	76	221
221_4	-/X	96	290
221_4	C/-	76	221

The program finds five compensatory indel sets for a given variant '221	C/-	76' indexing through 0 to 4.
